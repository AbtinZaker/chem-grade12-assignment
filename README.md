# Grade 12 Chemistry Labratory Plot Graphing

This project was done to create graphs for a labratory in the chemistry class. The graphs created demonstrate the relationship between Concentration and Rate of Reaction
and Temperature and Rate of Reaction. 

To reproduce the graphs, execute the two R scripts in `./R` folder.
